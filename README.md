# Statistical-Methods-Wine-Quality-Analysis-R-MS-Excel-
Description:
This project focused on wine quality evaluation using statistical computing techniques, primarily employing R and Microsoft Excel. The analysis aimed to enhance model precision for assessing wine quality from a dataset containing outliers, utilizing Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and Bootstrap methods. Additionally, hypothesis testing and correlation analysis were conducted to identify key factors influencing wine quality.

Key Points:

Data Preparation: The dataset containing wine quality attributes was processed to handle outliers and ensure data integrity for analysis.

Model Precision Enhancement: Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and Bootstrap methods were employed to improve model precision in evaluating wine quality, particularly in the presence of outliers. These techniques helped mitigate the impact of outliers and enhance the reliability of the analysis.

Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis testing was conducted to determine significant factors influencing wine quality. This involved formulating and testing hypotheses to identify statistically significant relationships between various attributes and wine quality.

Correlation Analysis: Correlation analysis was performed to examine the strength and direction of relationships between different variables and wine quality. This provided insights into which factors have the most significant impact on wine quality.

Recommendations: Based on the analysis, recommendations could be made to winemakers or vineyard owners regarding factors that significantly influence wine quality. This may include insights into aspects such as grape variety, acidity levels, alcohol content, and other key attributes.

This project demonstrates proficiency in statistical computing techniques, particularly in using R and Microsoft Excel for data analysis and model enhancement. By leveraging CLT, Bootstrap methods, hypothesis testing, and correlation analysis, valuable insights were derived to aid in wine quality assessment and decision-making processes within the wine industry.
