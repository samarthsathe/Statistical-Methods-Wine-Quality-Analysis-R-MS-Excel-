## Red Wine

### **Introduction**
Through statistical analysis and visualization, we embark on a journey to decipher the secrets hidden within the wineglass, revealing insights that may help winemakers, enthusiasts, and sommeliers alike appreciate the art and science behind the world of wine.

```{r}
#Importing the required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

***Importing the dataset***

```{r include=TRUE}
#Setting the file path using "here" library for importing the csv file
file_path1 <- here("Data", "winequality-red.csv")

#reading the csv file using read.csv function and using "sep=;" 
#to specific the delimiter in the csv file. 
data_red_wine <- read.csv(file_path1, sep = ";", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#The data provided has separation in semicolon instead of colon as in any normal 
#dataset and hence we had to specify the seperator.

#To view the data
view(data_red_wine)

attach(data_red_wine)
```

**Question 5a. Calculating Sample size**
```{r include=TRUE}
sample_size_red_wine <- nrow(data_red_wine)
cat("Sample size for red wine:", sample_size_red_wine, "\n")
```
  
1. ***Fixed.Acidity***
  
* We will first check the summary of fixed.acidity column

```{r include=TRUE}
summary(fixed.acidity)
```
  
**Question 5b. Any outliers? Do you have any concerns about the data quality?**
  
Observing the summary of fixed.acidity we can see that the range between the 3rd Quartile and Max is greater, which tells us that 75% of the data is till 9.20 and rest 25% is till 15.90. This indicates that there could be outliers in the data. 
  
```{r include=TRUE}
sum(is.na(fixed.acidity))
```

**Data quality concerns -** There are no missing values in the data and the statistics shows a typical distribution. The mean and median are relatively close to each other which suggests the skewness is not extreme. Using this data we can suggest that the data does not seem to have any quality issues. 
  
**Question 5c. How can you summarize the data of each variable in a concise way? What statistics are you going to present?**
  
Using the summary function we were able to get the min,1st quadrant,median, mean, 3rd quadrant and max values. Additional, we can calculate the variance, standard deviation.
```{r include=TRUE}
var(fixed.acidity)
sd(fixed.acidity)
mean(fixed.acidity)-2*sd(fixed.acidity)
mean(fixed.acidity)+2*sd(fixed.acidity)
sum((fixed.acidity>4.8 & fixed.acidity<11.8)==TRUE)/1599
```
Using the formula above we can see that the spread of data is ~94%
  
**Question 5d. How can you visualize the distribution of each variable?**
  
We can use boxplot and histogram to visualize the distribution.

```{r include=TRUE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
boxplot(fixed.acidity, main = "BoxPlot",col = "lightblue")
hist(fixed.acidity, freq = FALSE, main = "Histogram",col="lightblue")
